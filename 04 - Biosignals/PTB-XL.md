1. **Primary Arrhythmia-Related Labels in PTB-XL**  
    These are detailed ECG diagnoses mapped to **SNOMED CT codes**:
    
    - **Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)**
    - **Atrial Flutter**
    - **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)**
    - **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)**
    - **Ventricular Fibrillation (VFib)**
    - **Bradycardia (Slow Heart Rate)**
    - **Tachycardia (Fast Heart Rate)**
    - **Sick Sinus Syndrome (SSS)**
    - **AV Blocks (First, Second, and Third Degree)**
    - **Premature Atrial Contractions (PACs)**
    - **Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs)**
2. **How to Extract Arrhythmia Labels in PTB-XL**
    
    - The dataset provides a **"scp_codes"** column in its metadata, which contains detailed labels for each ECG.
    - You should filter for **arrhythmia-related SNOMED codes** instead of relying on just the superclass labels.
3. **Multi-Label Considerations**
    
    - A single ECG can show multiple arrhythmias (e.g., **AFib + AV Block**), so a **multi-label classification** approach might be needed.
    - Some arrhythmias may also co-occur with conditions like **Myocardial Infarction (MI)** or **ST/T Changes (STTC)**.

### **Approach for Arrhythmia Classification in PTB-XL**

- **Step 1:** Load the dataset and extract records with arrhythmia-related labels from `"scp_codes"`.
- **Step 2:** Preprocess the ECG signals (filtering, normalization, etc.).
- **Step 3:** Train a model (CNN, RNN, or Transformer-based architectures) on labeled ECGs.
- **Step 4:** Evaluate using multi-label classification metrics (AUC-ROC, F1-score, etc.).
