Explains what i wrote down with depol and repol.

![[ECG Time.png]]
- An **ECG** **electrode** is a **conductive** **pad** attached to the skin to **record** **electrical** **activity**.
- An **ECG** **lead** is a **graphical** **representation** of the **heart’s** **electrical** **activity** which is calculated by analysing data from **several ECG electrodes**.

A **12-lead ECG** records **12** **leads**, producing **12** **separate** **graphs** on a piece of ECG paper.

Only **10 physical electrodes** are attached to the patient to generate the **12** **leads**.

Graph shows heart's overall electric potential/voltage as it changes overtime during cardiac cycle
12 leads = 12 electrical views of the heart from 12 diff angles, 10 electrodes required, 1 to each limb, 6 onchest
Electrode on right leg is earth leg,
Lead 1: 
![[ECG limb leads.png]]

6 of the leads are calculated via the limb electrodes. We can create views from - to + and observe the view from + to -. 

aVR,aVL,aVF use 1 limb as positive and take average of inputs of other 2 as 0 reference.

Chest leads view the heart in horizontal plane. Unipolar leads.

Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Each component of ECG represents electrical activity in the heart, corresponding to different points in the cardiac cycle.

How to assert deviation?
If 1 + aVF are positive = normal
if aVF = negative and I = positive --> Right axis deviation
both negative = extreme deviation

Axis deviations can show further abnormalities

each square is 200ms, 5 squares = 1s. Therefore 1 beat every second or 60bpm
60 - 100bpm are good
<60bpm = bradycardia
.>100bpm tachycardia

Rhythm:
QRS is the spike, look at gap between these (R interval), is it the same each time?
irregular rhythmh if not.
If there is no regularity to the irregular heartbeat (diff everytime) --> Irregularly irregular (eg. atrial fibrillation)
or regularly irregular 

P-Wave is the first peak = atrial depolarizaiton

PR Interval:
time between atrial depolarization + ventrical depol.
Start of P-wave to start of QRS complex
![[PR interval features.png]]

QRS complex: ventricular depolarization
large amplitude may suggest ventrical hypertrophy
variable may indicate pericardial effusion

Q-waves is the first negative part in the QRS complex

ST-segment: interval between ventricular depol and repol

T-wave ventricular repolirization
