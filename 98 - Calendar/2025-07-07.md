~~Clean code~~
~~- Each client & the server should have their own data upon setup. Nothing should be created/split during train_self & give each client an index~~
~~- Remove any parameters passed during train_self if they can be accessed from the model (device)~~
- Add case statements which will alter all the data regarding the input datasets (image_size is an example of this)

Perform semi-supervised training w/ server model & add its own dataset. 
	**==> Tomorrow**

~~Add learning curves and writing to files for results (ask GPT and check bio code for all this)
- ~~Also add learning curves for test accuracy and perhaps confusion matrices?~~

Get some preliminary results to draw conclusions
> Check variance after X rounds of training// Learning trend/behavior (loss curves)
 
**==> Tomorrow**

Use cleaner plots.
How to display loss curves of models that sometimes did not train?
- Perhaps have to use an *(global)* epoch counter/field for the training_logs as sometimes models might not train.
