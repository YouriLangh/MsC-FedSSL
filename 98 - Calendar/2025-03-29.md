**Options:**
- *Type of Federated Learning*:
	- Horizontal FL: Share features (diff clients)
	- Vertical FL: Share clients (diff features)
	- Federated Transfer Learning: Not many samples or features in common
- *Data distribution of FL Clients*:
	- Only server has some labelled data (FedCon does this, they use contrastive learning
	- All clients have a bit of labelled data
	- Some clients are fully labelled others are fully unlabelled
- *Benchmarking / Evaluation*:
	- Ablation study
	- Two-sided with which models
	- Nr of (labelled vs unlabelled) clients, level of non-iid, amt of data, amt of labels
	- Different state of the art if possible.
- *Domain of application (decides the dataset) --> Influences downstream task* 
	- ECG: PTB-XL / MIT-BIH --> (single or multi) Classification/Prediction
- *Focus (Which part do we want to focus more on?)*: 
	- Aggregation method:
		- Model distillation with consensus (RSCFed)
		- Don't send parameters but send models (knowledge distillation) (adresses non-iid & low device participation apparently), Here you dont send models but send predictions on a public data set??
	- Local training-oriented method
- *Model layout* 
- *Privacy & security*:
	- Homomorphic encryption 
	- Differential privacy
- *Heterogeneity*:
	- Client (diagnostic strength of clients) --> Local biases (specialized hospitals)
	- Device (Processing capabilities)
	- Server-client models
- *Non-iid* (kind of heterogeneity):
	- Dirichlet distribution (to create it)
	- FedCVD (to create it )
	- Either data itself or features (not everyone has same)

**Handling unlabelled data:**
- *Semi-supervised learning*
	- Pseudo-labelling & thresholding
		- Dynamic thresholds 
- *Self-supervised learning*
	- Contrastive learning
	- Student-teacher approach
	- Context-based
	- temporal-based
	- ...
	- FedCLF
- *Transfer Learning* ???
- *Unsupervised Learning* ???
	- FedCA
	- FedX (uses knowledge distillation??)


FL is supposed to solve privacy & varying data distributions, but app it doesnt. (it doesnt solve data heterogeneity)

are those two difF?
heterogeneity --> devices & skewed distributions

Mitigating data hetero: Fed- OPT,NOVA,Prox,Avg

Basically, even self-slFL struggles with data heterogeneity
