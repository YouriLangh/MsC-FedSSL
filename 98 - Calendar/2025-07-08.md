*Add case statements which will alter all the data regarding the input datasets (image_size is an example of this) ==> Future work*

*Perform semi-supervised training w/ server model & add its own dataset.* 
	***==> Tomorrow**   ==> Future work*
 
~~Get some preliminary results to draw conclusions~~
> Check variance after X rounds of training// Learning trend/behavior (loss curves)
  **==> Tomorrow**

~~Use cleaner plots.~~
> How to display loss curves of models that sometimes did not train?
> - Perhaps have to use an *(global)* epoch counter/field for the training_logs as sometimes models might not train.

~~Add notes to (new) eval features (Especially in FedSSL)
~Just add notes to FedSSL, its a mess 
Clean code again~
~Add visualization options for Supervised model. 

~~Log in Dataframes, not JSON for SNS ==> Not possible in a clean manner due to different metrics.~~
~~We store id now in the training data --> alter utils.~~
Attempt to find out why the model is collapsing, use EDA or different tools.
Fix TQDM, where is best to put it?
