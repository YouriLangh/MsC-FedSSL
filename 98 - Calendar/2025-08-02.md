**TODO:**
~~Finish slides~~
~~Fix bug in code; my batch loop only loops until the minimum, how di prevent this? ~~
We have model collapse again with low labeled data & lambda_u = 1
- Unsupervised part/loss is doing smth wrong, even at 50% labeled, we have nrly 40% improvement WITHOUT it.
~~if i chqnge threshold to alter per epoc do i need to reset it every round?
- ~~Final round should be final threshold value (so do roundsx epochs for adaptive threshold)~~
Move some global hyperparams to cli
Validation with optuna & k-fold
Think about tests & run some to have results 
Recap & start writing

Unsure:
~~if i change stm to epochs, do i need to reset it every round?
- ~~Maybe yes maybe no~~

~~The supervised clients are just fixmatch clients but with diff settings tbh, dont rlly need it. But its easier than changing the params perma.~~
