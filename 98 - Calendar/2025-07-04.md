~~Add the adaptive threshold & features of yday to the supervised client model aswell.~~

~~Clean code ( move certain functions to utils from fixmatch)~~

~~Create a server model which performs semi-supervised learning with its own dataset.~~
> Note: The semi-supervised learning was not used, as I did not know how to separate/which data to use.

Add learning curves and writing to files for results (ask GPT and check bio code for all this)

Get some preliminary results to draw conclusions
> Check variance after X rounds of training// Learning trend/behavior (loss curves)
