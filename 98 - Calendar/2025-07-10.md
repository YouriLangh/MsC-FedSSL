~~[20, 50%, data ] data test with supervised clients ==> **Bug in FixMatch & in supervised clients. Results are TOO poor**~~ + how can i not just have clients with diff amts of data/labels? ==> Look into a better solution for this (add some field which can control the amt of data or smth.)
Resnet9 again ==> idk

Load meta info of dataset (dictionary) per dataset dependdent on CLI argument
>~~F1, recall,~~ precision

predictions scatter plot with color = actual label ==> How do the positions work in this?
%% Gradcam(p)s (heatmaps for the attention of neurons in the model?) ==> No %%

Use dataset metadata such that models load only their own data
yaml file for ddata or for hyperparameter
Look into pseudo label generation & distribution
~~>add a debug model to speed stuff up.
Remove Server training~~
