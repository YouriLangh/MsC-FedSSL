Finish the federated learning pipeline by today.
Investigate Simon's sources on Teams
Perform more basic research in the field and get more hands-on experience with everything.

Look at more recent papers that cited FedECG & see what I can do. Maybe also investigate newer approaches to FixMatch with for example pseudo-labelling & such

worked 1H to try and fix errors, got the code to work but there seems to be an error due to indentation prolly
