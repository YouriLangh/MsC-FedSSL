~~Should i have clients with diff amts of data/labels? isnt this just labeled % and n_clients for fdixmatch with lambda_u = 0? ==> Look into a better solution for this (add some field which can control the amt of data or smth.)~~

~~Generalze code for different datasets~~
~~yaml file for ddata or for hyperparameter
generalize yqml param loading~~

Check how cifar10 is loaded into the folder structure.
~~- Add support for saving results in subfolders (plots/cifar10 or plots/MNIST). This means altering result_vis.ipy and utils.py `save_results`~~
Find a good solution to test the global model / what should it be? **==> Done?**
- Perhaps check if its fixmatch or so what should all be possible depending on the client type chosen?

Make sure u_ratio works as desired, right now we sample U_ratio x batch_size, will this not cause issues?

~~Clean readme~~

==CLEAN & ~~test that everything works~~==

~~Load meta info of dataset (dictionary) per dataset dependdent on CLI argument~~
> precision?
