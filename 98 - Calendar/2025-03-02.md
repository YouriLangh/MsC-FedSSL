## Agenda
- Read [ResNet paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)
- Read a [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260723003255) evaluating Resnet's applicability to medical imaging.

I find that resnets are applicable due to their ability to remove the losing gradient problem, but they are not requiring more research.
