Read 2 papers, 3H. Made ptb-xl minor eda, 20m

Meeting questions:
What am i supposed to do? Which experiments? (just Resnets on the data?)
Do we switch the target industry for our application? Eg: education ...
Evaluation, multi-level? seems hard but maybe needed (FL separate, SSL sep, and then FSSL combined)
Ablation study?
FedCVD (pipeline/benchmark) paper seemed useful, esp ECG part

Do we combine multiple datasets to simplify our life?
Perhaps look into dynamic threshold for pseudo labels (DCBT)
Dirichlet distribution to generate non-iid data partition in clients
Might have to do an ablation study or use it from someone else (i think MoCo paper does this and another)

Not many studies use server with data --> mhm

Can use ISIC for naturally distributed dataset maybe?

Do we go on a different road (where does labelled data reside)


App context --> 1 labelled server
Hospital context --> Every hospital has labelled data + server

Future check; check when labels are distributed to 1 client rather than server

LoRa uses weight matrix to prevent catastrophic forgetting
Rather than update weights

Look for a pipeline for both evaluation & training

Experiment: Find/make a pipeline & either use a resnet model or their model.
Make bullet list of all issues/directions

Specialized hospitals (local biases)
