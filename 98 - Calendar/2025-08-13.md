â€¢ Furthermore, in practice, **all labeled data are also included as part of the unlabeled data pool (****U****) but without their labels** when `U` is constructed. This means labeled examples contribute to both the supervised loss (using their true labels) and the unsupervised loss (as if they were unlabeled examples, generating pseudo-labels for themselves).
