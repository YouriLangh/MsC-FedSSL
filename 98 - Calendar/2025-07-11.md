~~Remove server training code~~ ~~& Find a good solution to test the global model / what should it be?~~
~~Add a new function which computes all test metrics~~
~~Add new metrics (AUROC, F1, recall & look into different one from my impl)~~
~~==> Make the radar plot for fun~~
~~Make slides for Pieter (content)
- ~~Make a list of choices we made and why + 2 arguments why we chose this~~
~~Add a debug option for the simple model~~
perhaps switch to resnet9 for the moment. ==> ZZZZ, talk to simon perhaps abt this?

~~Add eval to each model so clients can easily be tested **==> Look into this more, needs to be easy to use & not just fluff code** *Perhaps we can use this to evaluate each individual clients & get some type of variance measure over the models for the thesis?*
