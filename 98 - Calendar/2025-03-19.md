Found another 2 papers discussing MIT-BIH but never show any preprocessing, one other (paper of 17/03) had same nr of samples even?

Slides require more detail (maybe only wrt deadlines n next steps) + the part of semi-supervised learning on local models & how that works

[Residual Networks (ResNet) [Physics Informed Machine Learning]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1UsKanMatM)


Worked on the pipeline, finished the semi-supervised aspect, added the ResNet model & performd augmentations 5H


Todo:
have to consider different augmentations (especially noise and such)
See if the processing pipeline works well with 10% of samples (just to see if it works in general)

Investigate robustness of pseudo-labelling & such
Investigate a different approach to weight updates (maybe knowledge distillation)

theres also different approaches to model compression (SVD / Laura)
SVD to compress student weights
Laura is used by LLM


Look at the sources Simon sent me
