*Is storing the labels actually useful? itd be useful if we add them to the labeled_loader.*
- We update our labeled data loader to contain the newly added sample
	We remove these samples from our other unlabeled dataloader
	After X rounds, the samples are removed from the labeled loader
	How often do we make these pseudo-labels? TOP K over thefirst epoch? Over many epochs? Do we regenerate every round or just do this once every 3 rounds? random or Top K?
TTL right now is in # rounds, but can be epochs. Epochs makes most sense in terms of "short-term" memory. But then do we do rolling or just simple restart after buffer is empty?

Threshol dper round or per epoch for each client? allowing clients to hav ediff thresholds ( i forgot ) **epoch** i think

Head ontop of backbone is kinda mhmm if i just copy of 1 client, i like the idea but we need a better solution for the head aswell.

What should my server be? should itb e a copy of the client or is supervised client ok if we just evaluate on it.

Find a good solution to test the global model / what should it be? **==> Done?**
- Perhaps check if its fixmatch or so what should all be possible depending on the client type chosen?

Wtf do i tune with optuna, not model architecture right?

*Shouldd we support different backbones? --> Question*

I still have to add Optuna & hyperparam tuning code. Though everything else seems to be in place now (except retaining hyperparams & making sure each client only loads their own data.)
Isolate labeled_fractions

Lambda, loss function, learning rate; threshold function we use,
Final threshold should be fixed.

n_clients: 10
Epochs, 2, 10, 50, 100

Fixed size ordered dictionary as memory structure for utils

~~People use EMA (smoothed out trajectory) But use Probability for taking samples. like exploration exploitation ( 1 in X we explore the new pseuddolabel (save it) rest we exploit, dont doanyything.)~~

== Look at variance of main model results or smth

~~Make sure u_ratio works as desired, right now we sample U_ratio x batch_size, will this not cause issues?~~

~~>add precision?~~
