*Should i have clients with diff amts of data/labels? isnt this just labeled % and n_clients for fdixmatch with lambda_u = 0? ==> Look into a better solution for this (add some field which can control the amt of data or smth.)*
*Resnet9 again ==> idk*

Threshol dper round or per epoch for each client? allowing clients to hav ediff thresholds ( i forgot )

*Retain pseudo-labels for rounds or epochs? I think epochs right? --> Question*

Find a good solution to test the global model / what should it be? **==> Done?**
- Perhaps check if its fixmatch or so what should all be possible depending on the client type chosen?

Wtf do i tune with optuna, not model architecture right?

*Shouldd we support different backbones? --> Question*

I still have to add Optuna & hyperparam tuning code. Though everything else seems to be in place now (except retaining hyperparams & making sure each client only loads their own data.)

~~Make sure u_ratio works as desired, right now we sample U_ratio x batch_size, will this not cause issues?~~
