~~Load all dependencies and perform a simple test~~

~~Split the model into backbone and head (do research and first ask GPT to guide you)
> Make the head using MLP 3 layers and then hidden and simple activation???~~

Create a server model which performs semi-supervised learning with its own dataset.

~~Update the threshold for pseudo-labels over epochs either linearly or using different function~~
> There is a measure which allows you to see how confident a prediction and then we can adapt the threshold based on that but this is very complicated, currently we will simply update the threshold

Add learning curves and writing to files for results (ask GPT and check bio code for all this)

Clean code

Get some preliminary results to draw conclusions
> Check variance after X rounds of training// Learning trend/behavior (loss curves)
