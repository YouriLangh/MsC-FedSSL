Since our data has reduced dimensionality, we dont need as big of a batch size as SimCLR

In this paper the authors use the CNN of xresnet1d-family. 1D adaptations of the popular xresnet which has been shown to be very good at ECG classifcation on PTB-XL

Not a lot of work has been done of 12-lead data.

Ref 31 might be interesting to look at.

Source code + data available!!!
