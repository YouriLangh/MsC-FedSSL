#FL 

FL is an iterative & collaborative setting

FL breaks a lot of rules with centralized ML, decentralized ML and distributed ML.

Massively growing research problem!

They mention other surveys about FL

The paper of Yang, Liu, Chen, and Tong 2019b discusses vertical, horizontal & FTL 

Gives a different approach to semi-supervised learning

Best optimization algorithm for FL is FedAvg (in that time), but assumes homogeneous network settings at client & server.

Due to device heterogeneity, we have diff computation times & capacities --> Heterogeneous FL & async FL

Discusses some applciations of FL to healthcare and their corresponding papers.
