#FL 

This paper also talks of MIT-BIH dataset, which has same number of samples as [[FedECG]].

Asif, R. N. et al. Detecting electrocardiogram arrhythmia empowered with weighted federated learning. IEEE Access (2023). Might be useful to look at, especially for preprocessing

My note: Perhaps a meta-data diversity factor for each client to weight them is useful.

"Model compression & quantization before transferring weights"

Algorithm code for FL is here as well.

Explains A-Fib:
As shown in Figure 5, the normal ECG has regular RR intervals and P wave is present, whereas, in the AFib signal the RR intervals are irregular and the P wave is absent.
