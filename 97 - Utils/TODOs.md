- [x] Fix other baselines with new datasets ✅ 2025-08-13
- [ ] **Revisit all code n make sure no bugs**
- [x] I think the indices are wrong for the datasets. ✅ 2025-08-13
- [ ] In the future, remove some of the baselines and replace with arguments? Baseline3 is not needed, if baseline 2 with 1 client. & Same goes for baseline 2.
- [x] Perhaps adjust multi run to init datasets at every iter, perhaps the data is getting altered as the pretrain losses != ✅ 2025-08-16
- [x] I think the low performance is due to FixMatch using cycling over smallest dataset rather than just going over rit once. ✅ 2025-08-14
- [ ] Read FixMatch
