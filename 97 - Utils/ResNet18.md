**ResNet18 has 18 layers**, but they are grouped into **four major blocks**:

- `layer1`, `layer2`, `layer3`, and `layer4`
    

These **"layers" are actually blocks of residual layers**, and the `18` refers to the **total number of weight layers** (convolutional + fully connected).

### üìä Breakdown of ResNet18:

|Layer Group|Structure|# of Conv Layers|
|---|---|---|
|`conv1`|Initial conv + BN + ReLU|1|
|`layer1`|2 √ó BasicBlock (2 convs each)|4|
|`layer2`|2 √ó BasicBlock (2 convs each)|4|
|`layer3`|2 √ó BasicBlock (2 convs each)|4|
|`layer4`|2 √ó BasicBlock (2 convs each)|4|
|`fc`|Final fully connected layer|1|
|**Total**||**18**|

### üîç Internals of Each Block

Each `BasicBlock` consists of:

- 2 convolutional layers
    
- Each followed by BatchNorm and ReLU
    
- Plus the residual connection
    

So:

- `layer1` has 2 BasicBlocks ‚Üí 4 conv layers
    
- `layer2` has 2 BasicBlocks ‚Üí 4 conv layers
    
- And so on...
    

That‚Äôs how you end up with:

```python
1 (conv1) + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 (fc) = 18 layers
```

### üß† Why Does This Matter?

When splitting the model:

- **Backbone** = `conv1` to `layer4` + `avgpool`
    
- **Head** = `fc` or your custom MLP
    

This makes it natural to define the backbone using:

```python
self.features = nn.Sequential(
    resnet.conv1,
    resnet.bn1,
    resnet.relu,
    resnet.maxpool,
    resnet.layer1,
    resnet.layer2,
    resnet.layer3,
    resnet.layer4,
    resnet.avgpool
)
```
