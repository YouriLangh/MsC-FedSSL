- **Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL):** Uses a mix of **labeled and unlabeled** data. The model is trained with a small set of labeled data and then improves itself by predicting labels for the remaining unlabeled data (e.g., pseudo-labeling).



- **Self-Supervised Learning (Self-SL):** A form of unsupervised learning where the model generates **its own labels** from unlabeled data. It learns by solving **pretext tasks** (e.g., predicting missing parts of data, learning relationships, or using contrastive learning). The model doesnâ€™t rely on manually labeled data at all.
